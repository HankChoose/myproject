                                                  <p>Bootstrap is a popular open-source front-end framework that simplifies web development by providing pre-built HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components and templates. It was initially created by Twitter and is now maintained by a community of developers. Bootstrap allows web developers to create responsive and visually appealing websites and web applications with less effort. Here are some key features and concepts associated with Bootstrap:</p>
